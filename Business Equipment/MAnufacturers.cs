/*
Karn is a rich man and lives in Vice City. 
He has started a new business of Sports equipment. 
There are N manufactures shops in the city and 
Karn want to meet as many as possible as he 
wishes to maximise his chances of getting good deals. 
The shops are numbered from 1 to N. 
The city is constructed in a way that karn can reach
any of the other shop from the current shop he is in.

There are P paths between these N Shops. 
Each of the path carries a cost C to travel. 
As Karn is rich, he wishes to spend maximum money to 
visit as many shops as possible. 
The city has a unique system of cost collection of 
path travelled. 
It charges you to travel on it for the first time 
but if you travel on it again, it does not charge you.


Example:
If Karn travels on a path from Shop 1 to Shop 2, 
he will be charged cost C. 
Now, if he travel back to Shop 1 from Shop 2, he will be charged 0.
Karn wants to focus on driving and 
wants to know the maximum money he would have to spend. 
Can you tell him the Maximum amount ?

Note: No cycle is allowed.

Input Format
The first line of input consists of number of test cases, T.

The first line of each test case consists of two space separated integers, N and P.

Next P lines consists of three space separated integers, X, Y and C where 
X and Y represents the shop numbers and indicate a path between the two. 
C is the cost to travel on the path.


Constraints
1<= T <=10
1<= N <=100000
1<= P <=1000000
1<= C <=1000


Output Format
For each test case, print the required output in a separate line.

Explanation

Test Case 1: 
The maximum money Karn has to spend = 220.
One way of meeting N manufacturers is :
Karn starts from shop 4 and move to shop 2. Cost = 40. He comes back to shop 4. Cost = 0
Karn move to shop 5 from shop 4. Cost = 70
Karn moves from shop 5 to shop 3. Cost = 60
Karn moves from shop 3 to shop 1. Cost = 50
Now, Karn has met with all N manufacturers.
Total Cost = 40 + 70 + 60 + 50 = 220



Test Case 2:
The maximum money Karn has to spend = 340
One way of meeting N manufacturers is :
Karn moves from shop 3 to shop 2. Cost = 100. He comes back to shop 3. Cost = 0
Karn moves from shop 3 to shop 5. Cost = 90
Karn moves from shop 5 to shop 4. Cost = 70
Karn moves from 4 to shop 1. Cost = 80
Now, Karn has met with all N manufacturers.
Total Cost = 100 + 90 + 70 + 80 = 340
